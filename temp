# 🏦 Senior Java Developer – Banking (12 Question Flow)

---

## 🟢 1️⃣ Warm-Up (Understanding Their Level)

**Q1.**
Can you briefly describe the architecture of your current system and your role in it?

👉 You’re checking:

* Microservices?
* REST?
* Database?
* Kafka/MQ?
* Cloud?
* Ownership level?

---

## 🟢 2️⃣ Core Java Fundamentals (Short & Tricky)

**Q2.**
What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()`? Why is it important in HashMap?

👉 Expect:

* Reference vs content
* equals + hashCode contract

---

**Q3.**
What happens if you modify a key after inserting it into a HashMap?

👉 Expect:

* Hash changes
* Entry becomes unreachable
* Very dangerous

---

**Q4.**
Why should we use `BigDecimal` instead of `double` in financial systems?

👉 Precision issue explanation.

---

## 🟢 3️⃣ Spring & Transactions (Critical in Banking)

**Q5.**
What does `@Transactional` actually do?

👉 Expect:

* Starts transaction
* Commit / rollback
* Proxy-based
* Runtime exception rollback

---

**Q6.**
How would you prevent double payment processing in a money transfer API?

👉 Look for:

* Idempotency key
* Unique DB constraint
* Status check
* Locking

This is a strong filter question.

---

## 🟢 4️⃣ Messaging (Kafka / MQ)

**Q7.**
What happens if a Kafka consumer crashes before committing offset?

👉 Expect:

* Message reprocessed
* Need idempotent handling

---

**Q8.**
What is idempotency and why is it important in banking systems?

👉 Must explain clearly.

---

## 🟢 5️⃣ Database & Concurrency

**Q9.**
What is the difference between optimistic and pessimistic locking?

👉 Banking relevance = consistency.

---

**Q10.**
If two requests try to update the same account balance simultaneously, what problems can happen?

👉 Expect:

* Race condition
* Lost update
* Need transaction isolation or locking

---

## 🟢 6️⃣ Security

**Q11.**
How do you secure REST APIs in a banking application?

👉 Expect:

* OAuth2 / JWT
* Role-based access
* HTTPS
* Input validation

---

## 🟢 7️⃣ Production Mindset (Senior Filter)

**Q12.**
Describe a production issue you handled. What was your debugging approach?

👉 Look for:

* Logs
* Metrics
* Monitoring
* Calm thinking
* Root cause analysis

---

# 🎯 What This Flow Tests

* Java depth
* Transaction safety
* Financial precision awareness
* Messaging reliability
* Concurrency handling
* Security awareness
* Production maturity

---

# 💡 If Candidate Is Very Strong

Add one bonus:

> “What can go wrong if DB commit succeeds but Kafka publish fails?”

Strong candidate may mention:

* Inconsistent state
* Outbox pattern
* Retry strategy

---

If you want, I can now give you:

* ⚡ A quick 5-question rapid-fire round
* 🧾 A scoring template
* 🎤 A confident opening script to start the interview smoothly

Let’s keep it **basic but slightly tricky**, suitable for a **Senior Java Developer (Banking)** — nothing too theoretical, just practical understanding.

I’ll give you a clean set of:

* ✅ 8 Basic Java questions
* ✅ 5 Maven questions
* With short expected answers so you can evaluate quickly.

---

# 🟢 BASIC JAVA QUESTIONS (8)

---

### 1️⃣ What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()`?

**Expected:**

* `==` compares references.
* `.equals()` compares content.
* For HashMap keys → must override equals + hashCode.

---

### 2️⃣ Why must we override `hashCode()` if we override `equals()`?

**Expected:**

* Equal objects must have same hashCode.
* Otherwise HashMap/HashSet won’t work correctly.

If they don’t mention collections → weak.

---

### 3️⃣ What is immutability? Why is `String` immutable?

**Expected:**

* Object cannot change after creation.
* Thread-safe.
* Safe for caching (String pool).
* Security reasons.

---

### 4️⃣ What happens if an exception occurs inside `@Transactional` method?

**Expected:**

* Rolls back on RuntimeException.
* Checked exceptions don’t rollback by default.
* Managed by proxy.

---

### 5️⃣ Difference between `List` and `Set`?

**Expected:**

* List allows duplicates.
* Set does not.
* List maintains order.
* Set (HashSet) does not guarantee order.

---

### 6️⃣ What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?

**Expected:**

* ArrayList → dynamic array, fast random access.
* LinkedList → doubly linked list, fast insert/delete.
* ArrayList better in most cases.

---

### 7️⃣ What is a race condition?

**Expected:**

* Multiple threads modifying shared data.
* Leads to inconsistent results.
* Fix using synchronization / atomic classes.

---

### 8️⃣ What is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?

**Expected:**

* `throw` → actually throws exception.
* `throws` → declares exception in method signature.

---

# 🟣 MAVEN QUESTIONS (5)

Very important in enterprise banking systems.

---

### 1️⃣ What is the purpose of Maven?

**Expected:**

* Build tool.
* Dependency management.
* Lifecycle management.
* Packaging (jar/war).

---

### 2️⃣ What is the Maven lifecycle?

**Expected phases:**

* validate
* compile
* test
* package
* verify
* install
* deploy

They don’t need to say all — but should know basic flow.

---

### 3️⃣ What is the difference between `compile`, `test`, and `provided` scope?

**Expected:**

* `compile` → available everywhere.
* `test` → only for tests.
* `provided` → needed at compile time, but provided by runtime (e.g., servlet container).

If they understand scope → good experience.

---

### 4️⃣ What is a multi-module Maven project?

**Expected:**

* Parent POM.
* Multiple child modules.
* Centralized dependency/version management.
* Used in microservices or layered apps.

---

### 5️⃣ What is dependency conflict? How does Maven resolve it?

**Expected:**

* Transitive dependencies.
* “Nearest definition” wins.
* Can use dependencyManagement to control versions.

If they mention `mvn dependency:tree` → strong.

---

# ⭐ Bonus Easy Maven Question

### What is the difference between `install` and `deploy`?

**Expected:**

* install → installs artifact in local repo.
* deploy → pushes to remote repository (Nexus/Artifactory).

---

# 🎯 How to Use This

Pick:

* 4 Java
* 2–3 Maven
* 2 Spring/transaction
* 1 scenario

That’s a perfect 15-minute mix.

---

If you want, I can now:

* ⚡ Create a final 15-min combined flow (Java + Maven + Banking)
* 🧠 Give you 5 slightly tricky Maven questions
* 🎯 Or give you model answers in 1-line format for quick reference during interview
