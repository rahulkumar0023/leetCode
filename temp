For the Citrix decommissioning, please find below the updated communication for better clarity:

Accessing DEV API endpoints, MQ, Kafka topics, and Elasticsearch works fine from MAC laptops in BE. No new issues have been reported by developers.

For the above points in (1), in CET, access might not work from MAC due to differences in infrastructure.

Issues raised by CET testers for API endpoints (not accessible because of different infrastructure – tracker added here).

Another solution is to use HVD profiles for CET developers and testers – Dieter's approval is needed.

All the above points relate to API endpoints, MQ, Kafka topics, Elasticsearch, and similar access requirements for legacy infrastructure.

For FTP/SSH access, it is not allowed directly from the Mac terminal or via WinSCP from a Mac. For this purpose, users need to request a CyberArk connection. It can be arranged for all environments with a valid justification and an INC number (required for higher environments). This solution supports both PuTTY-type and WinSCP-type connections.
For CyberArk, there is currently one open issue (attached). Developers will need a similar level of access as the Springboot user had.
