Let’s focus on **S3, IAM, EC2, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CloudFormation** — practical questions suitable for a Senior Java Developer in banking.

I’ll give you:

* ❓ Question
* ✅ What a strong answer should include

---

# 🟢 S3 QUESTIONS

---

### 1️⃣ What is the difference between S3 standard and S3 Glacier?

**Expected:**

* Standard → frequent access.
* Glacier → archival storage, cheaper, slower retrieval.
* Lifecycle rules can move objects automatically.

---

### 2️⃣ What is S3 versioning?

**Expected:**

---

### 3️⃣ How do you secure an S3 bucket?

**Expected:**

* IAM policies
* Bucket policies

* Restrict via VPC endpoint

If they mention:

* Avoid public buckets
  → strong.

---

### 4️⃣ What is the difference between SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS?

**Expected:**

* SSE-S3 → managed by AWS.
* SSE-KMS → uses AWS KMS keys, more control, audit logging.

Banking → KMS preferred.

---

# 🟣 IAM QUESTIONS

---

### 5️⃣ What is the difference between IAM User and IAM Role?

**Expected:**

* User → long-term credentials.
* Role → temporary credentials.
* Roles used by EC2, Lambda.

If they mention:
“Never store credentials in code”
→ strong.

---

### 6️⃣ What is the principle of least privilege?

**Expected:**

* Grant minimum required permissions.
* Reduce attack surface.

---

### 7️⃣ What happens if two policies conflict?

**Expected:**

* Explicit deny overrides allow.

This is a good tricky IAM question.

---

# 🔵 EC2 QUESTIONS

---

### 8️⃣ What is the difference between Security Group and NACL?

**Expected:**

* SG → Stateful.
* NACL → Stateless.
* SG at instance level.
* NACL at subnet level.

---

### 9️⃣ What is an AMI?

**Expected:**

* Amazon Machine Image.
* Template to launch EC2 instances.

---

### 🔟 What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?

**Expected:**

* Vertical → increase instance size.
* Horizontal → add more instances.
* Horizontal preferred for high availability.

---

# 🟠 CODEPIPELINE QUESTIONS

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ What is CodePipeline?

**Expected:**

* CI/CD orchestration service.
* Automates build, test, deploy.
* Integrates with CodeBuild, CodeDeploy.

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ What are stages in CodePipeline?

**Expected:**

* Source
* Build
* Test
* Deploy

Should understand flow.

---

# 🟡 CODEBUILD QUESTIONS

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ What is CodeBuild?

**Expected:**

* Managed build service.
* Compiles code.
* Runs tests.
* Produces artifacts.

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ What is buildspec.yml?

**Expected:**

* Defines build commands.
* Phases: install, pre_build, build, post_build.
* Specifies artifacts.

If they know buildspec phases → strong.

---

# 🔴 CLOUDFORMATION QUESTIONS

---

### 1️⃣5️⃣ What is CloudFormation?

**Expected:**

* Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
* Templates define AWS resources.
* JSON or YAML.

---

### 1️⃣6️⃣ What is a stack?

**Expected:**

* Collection of AWS resources managed together.

---

**Q8.**
What is idempotency and why is it important in banking systems?

👉 Must explain clearly.

---

## 🟢 5️⃣ Database & Concurrency

**Q9.**
What is the difference between optimistic and pessimistic locking?

👉 Banking relevance = consistency.

---

**Q10.**
If two requests try to update the same account balance simultaneously, what problems can happen?

👉 Expect:

* Race condition
* Lost update
* Need transaction isolation or locking

---

## 🟢 6️⃣ Security

Let’s keep it **basic but slightly tricky**, suitable for a **Senior Java Developer (Banking)** — nothing too theoretical, just practical understanding.

I’ll give you a clean set of:

* ✅ 8 Basic Java questions
* ✅ 5 Maven questions
* With short expected answers so you can evaluate quickly.

---

# 🟢 BASIC JAVA QUESTIONS (8)

---

### 1️⃣ What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()`?

**Expected:**

* `==` compares references.
* `.equals()` compares content.
* For HashMap keys → must override equals + hashCode.

---

### 2️⃣ Why must we override `hashCode()` if we override `equals()`?

**Expected:**

* Equal objects must have same hashCode.
* Otherwise HashMap/HashSet won’t work correctly.

If they don’t mention collections → weak.

---

### 3️⃣ What is immutability? Why is `String` immutable?

**Expected:**

* Object cannot change after creation.
* Thread-safe.
* Safe for caching (String pool).
* Security reasons.

---

### 4️⃣ What happens if an exception occurs inside `@Transactional` method?

**Expected:**

* Rolls back on RuntimeException.
* Checked exceptions don’t rollback by default.
* Managed by proxy.

---

### 5️⃣ Difference between `List` and `Set`?

**Expected:**

* List allows duplicates.
* Set does not.
* List maintains order.
* Set (HashSet) does not guarantee order.

---

### 6️⃣ What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?

**Expected:**

* ArrayList → dynamic array, fast random access.
* LinkedList → doubly linked list, fast insert/delete.
* ArrayList better in most cases.

---

### 7️⃣ What is a race condition?

**Expected:**

* Multiple threads modifying shared data.
* Leads to inconsistent results.
* Fix using synchronization / atomic classes.

---

### 8️⃣ What is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?

**Expected:**

* `throw` → actually throws exception.
* `throws` → declares exception in method signature.

---

# 🟣 MAVEN QUESTIONS (5)

Very important in enterprise banking systems.

---

### 1️⃣ What is the purpose of Maven?

**Expected:**

* Build tool.
* Dependency management.
* Lifecycle management.
* Packaging (jar/war).

---

### 2️⃣ What is the Maven lifecycle?

**Expected phases:**

* validate
* compile
* test
* package
* verify
* install
* deploy

They don’t need to say all — but should know basic flow.

---

### 3️⃣ What is the difference between `compile`, `test`, and `provided` scope?

**Expected:**

* `compile` → available everywhere.
* `test` → only for tests.
* `provided` → needed at compile time, but provided by runtime (e.g., servlet container).

If they understand scope → good experience.

---

### 4️⃣ What is a multi-module Maven project?

**Expected:**

* Parent POM.
* Multiple child modules.
* Centralized dependency/version management.
* Used in microservices or layered apps.

---

### 5️⃣ What is dependency conflict? How does Maven resolve it?

**Expected:**

* Transitive dependencies.
* “Nearest definition” wins.
* Can use dependencyManagement to control versions.

If they mention `mvn dependency:tree` → strong.

---

# ⭐ Bonus Easy Maven Question

### What is the difference between `install` and `deploy`?

**Expected:**

* install → installs artifact in local repo.
* deploy → pushes to remote repository (Nexus/Artifactory).

---

# 🎯 How to Use This

Pick:

* 4 Java
* 2–3 Maven
* 2 Spring/transaction
* 1 scenario

That’s a perfect 15-minute mix.
