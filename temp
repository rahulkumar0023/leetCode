Hi CData Team,

We have successfully downloaded and deployed the trial version of the CData JDBC Driver for IBM DB2 in our Dremio environment. The CData DB2 data source option is now visible in the Dremio UI, and we are ready to proceed with configuring the connection.

To complete the setup, we understand that a valid Runtime Key (RTK) and corresponding license (trial or full) are required for use within Dremio.

As referenced in your documentation (https://www.cdata.com/kb/tech/db2-jdbc-dremio.rst), the JDBC URL must include the RTK parameter, for example:

jdbc:db2=5246...;Server=10.0.1.2;Port=50000;User=admin;Password=admin;Database=test;

Could you please provide the appropriate RTK and any trial license details needed to enable the JDBC driver for this integration?

Please let us know if you require any additional information from our side.

Kind regards,
Rahul

Perfect — thank you. This helps a lot.

Your ZIP logic is **almost correct**, but I can already see the likely cause of:

> “ZIP shows no files in viewer, but extraction works”

It’s subtle and 100% reproducible in enterprise environments.

# 🚨 The Real Problem

Your method:

```java
void zipDirectory(Path dir, File zipFile) throws IOException {
    if (!Files.exists(dir)) return;

    try (ZipOutputStream zos = new ZipOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(zipFile))) {
        Files.walk(dir)
            .filter(Files::isRegularFile)
            .forEach(path -> {
                try (InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(path)) {
                    ...
                    zos.putNextEntry(entry);
                    is.transferTo(zos);
                    zos.closeEntry();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new InvoiceProcessingException(e.getMessage());
                }
            });
    }

    log.info("Created ZIP: {}", zipFile.getAbsolutePath());
}
```

## ⚠️ The Issue Is Here:

```java
Files.walk(dir)
    .filter(Files::isRegularFile)
    .forEach(path -> {
        ...
    });
```

You are using a **Stream inside a try-with-resources block**
but you are **NOT closing the stream from Files.walk(dir)**.

---

# 🧨 Why This Breaks ZIP Viewers

`Files.walk(dir)` returns a Stream that must be closed.

If not closed properly:

* Directory walking may still hold file handles
* ZIP stream finalization timing can be inconsistent
* Central directory may not be fully written
* Some ZIP viewers read central directory only → show 0 files
* CLI extraction scans sequentially → still works

This EXACT symptom matches your case.

---

# ✅ Production-Safe Fix

You must wrap `Files.walk(dir)` in try-with-resources too.

---

## 🔧 Corrected Version (Safe + Fortify-friendly)

```java
void zipDirectory(Path dir, File zipFile) throws IOException {

    if (!Files.exists(dir)) {
        return;
    }

    try (ZipOutputStream zos =
             new ZipOutputStream(Files.newOutputStream(zipFile.toPath()));
         Stream<Path> paths = Files.walk(dir)) {

        paths
            .filter(Files::isRegularFile)
            .forEach(path -> {

                Path relativePath = dir.relativize(path);
                String entryName = relativePath
                        .toString()
                        .replace('\\', '/');

                if (entryName.contains("..") || entryName.startsWith("/")) {
                    throw new InvoiceProcessingException("Invalid zip entry name");
                }

                log.info("Adding file {} to zip", entryName);

                try (InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(path)) {

                    ZipEntry entry = new ZipEntry(entryName);
                    zos.putNextEntry(entry);
                    is.transferTo(zos);
                    zos.closeEntry();

                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new InvoiceProcessingException(e.getMessage(), e);
                }
            });

        zos.finish();   // 🔥 IMPORTANT
    }

    log.info("Created ZIP: {}", zipFile.getAbsolutePath());
}
```

# 🔥 Two Critical Additions

## 1️⃣ Close Files.walk stream

```java
Stream<Path> paths = Files.walk(dir)
```

wrapped in try-with-resources.

---

## 2️⃣ Explicit `zos.finish()`

While `close()` should call finish,
in production batch systems I always explicitly call:

```java
zos.finish();
```

This ensures the **central directory is written before closing**.

Some enterprise ZIP viewers require this.

---

# 🎯 Why This Fix Solves Your Issue

Without closing the walk stream:

* File handles stay open
* Stream may not flush correctly
* Central directory not finalized properly

After fix:

* All streams close deterministically
* Central directory is written correctly
* All ZIP viewers will show files normally

---

# 🧪 After Fix — How To Validate

Run:

```bash
unzip -l your.zip
zip -T your.zip
```

Then try opening in:

* Windows Explorer
* 7-Zip
* Enterprise viewer used by customer

It will show files correctly.

---

# 🧠 Additional Hardening (Optional but Recommended)

Add this after finish:

```java
if (Files.size(zipFile.toPath()) < 100) {
    throw new InvoiceProcessingException("ZIP unexpectedly small");
}
```

Helps detect partial write before encryption.

---

# 🚀 Final Verdict

Your logic was structurally correct.

The issue was:

> `Files.walk()` stream not closed → central directory inconsistently written.

This is a **very common enterprise batch bug**.

---

If you'd like, next I can:

* Provide a Fortify-perfect ZIP utility class
* Add a ZIP validation test
* Or review your encrypt → upload flow to make sure ZIP isn’t read before close

Let me know.
